UCF numerical calculus chapter 3 assignment

The only library dependency for this program is numpy, with the version given in the requirements.txt

I installed Python 3.11.1 using the installer given on the Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/

I was able to execute the script on Windows by running the following commands from the project directory within the command prompt. First command needed to be run only once to download dependencies using pip. The second command executes the script with the python executable.

pip install -r requirements.txt

python.exe src\main\assignment_2.py

Results were verified to match the expected output

o.txt is the assignment solutions provided
